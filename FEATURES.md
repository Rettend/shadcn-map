# Map

My rought requirements:

- Very sleek and minimalist, background dark gray, roads slightly ligher gray, and maybe rivers, that's it.
- Custom pins/markers with iconify icons
- Custom bubble markers for pins, these can be text or iconify icons
- Pins group dynamically based on zoom level, and the label becomes the number of pins in the group
- Basic Map controls, pins open large full height details panel on right, or small popup in place
- Large sidebar has search and filters, (maybe a planning mode too? or better delegate that to google maps or something)
- On mobile the left sidebar is a drawer on the bottom or full screen, the popup is a drawer on the bottom or the same in place popup as desktop
